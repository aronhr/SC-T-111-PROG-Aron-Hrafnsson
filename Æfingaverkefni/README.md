Programming Exercises
1. Create a program that takes two integers as input and prints their sum.
2. Create a program that takes 3 integers as input and prints their sum.
3. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input and prints their product.
4. Create a program that takes an integer and a string as input, let’s call the integer age and the
string name. Next your program should print the text: “Hello, my name is <name> and my age is
<age>.” where <name> and <age> are the values that were input.
5. Create a program that takes 2 strings as input, let´s call them firstname and lastname. They
should hold (as the names of them imply) the first and last name of the user. Next you should
create a variable called fullname which stores the concatenated value of the variables firstname
and lastname. Finally, the program should print the text “Your full name is <fullname>” where
<fullname> is the value of the variable fullname.
6. Create a program that accepts an integer as input, lets call it celsius. This value will represent a
temperature on the celsius scale. Next you program should print the corresponding value on the
Fahrenheit scale.The formula for converting celsius to Fahrenheit is as follows:
(degrees in celsius) * 9/5 + 32
7. Create a program that accepts 2 integers as input and outputs the greater integer. If the integers
are equal the program should print the text “the numbers are equal”.
8. Create a program that takes 2 strings as input. If the strings are the same length the program
should print “The strings are the same length”. If they are not the same length the program
shouldn’t print anything.
9. Create a program that takes 3 integers as input and prints the integer with the lowest value.
10. Create a program that takes 1 integer as input. The program should print ”Less than 10” if the
input value is less than 10. If the input value is greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20 it
should print “between 10 and 20”. If the input value is greater than or equal to 20 the program
should print “the value is too high!” and if the input value is less than 0 the program should print
“too low”.
11. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them a and b. Next the user should be
able to input another integer which we shall call choice. If choice is 1 then the program should
add a and b together and print the result. If choice is 2 the program should subtract b from a and
print the result. If choice is 3 the program should multiply a and b together and print the result. If
choice is any other number the program should print the text: “invalid input.”

These exercises should be implemented with a while loop and a for
loop
12. Create a program that prints all the integers between 1 and 10 (1 and 10 included).
13. Create a program that prints all the integers between -5 and 10 (-5 and 10 included).
14. Create a program that prints all the integers between 3 and 13 (3 and 13 included) multiplied by
two.
15. Create a program that lets the user input a single integer, lets call it multiplier. Next your
program should print all the integers between 2 and 15 (2 and 15 included) multiplied by the
value of multiplier.
16. Create a program that prints all the integers from 10 down to 0 (10 and 0 included).
17. Create a program that prints all the odd integers from 15 down to 3 (15 and 3 included).
18. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should print all the integers between low and high (low and high included). You may assume that
low is always lower than high.
19. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should output all the integers between low and high but only if the value of low is lower than the
value of high. (if printed the values of low and high should be included).
20. Create a program that takes an integer as input, let´s call it turns. This integer should indicate
how many times the user wants to input a new integer. Next the program should let the user
input turns many integers. For each input value the program should print “you picked <value>”
where value is the integer the user input.
So if the user inputs 3 to begin with that means that the variable turns should get the value 3 and
the user should be able to input 3 more integers.
21. Create the same program as in assignment 20 with one change. Now the text “you picked
<value>” where value is the number that was input should only be printed if that value is an odd
number.
22. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should print the sum of all the integers between low and high(low and high included). You may
assume that low is always lower than high.
23. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should print the sum of all the odd numbers between low and high(low and high included). You
may assume that low is always lower than high.
24. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should print the sum of all the integers between low and high(low and high included) that are
divisible by 3. You may assume that low is always lower than high.

25. Create a program that takes 2 integers as input, let’s call them low and high. Your program
should print the sum of all the integers between low and high(low and high included) that are
divisible by 3 or 5. You may assume that low is always lower than high.
26. Create a program that takes an integer as input, let´s call it turns. This integer should indicate
how many times the user wants to input a new integer. Next the program should let the user
input turns many integers. The program should then print how many negative integers the user
input.
27. Create a program that takes an integer as input, let´s call it turns. This integer should indicate
how many times the user wants to input a new integer. Next the program should let the user
input turns many integers. The program should then print the sum of all the negative integers
the user input.
28. Create a program that takes an integer as input, let´s call it turns. This integer should indicate
how many times the user wants to input a new integer. Next the program should let the user
input turns many integers. The program should then print how many negative integers the user
input and how many positive integers the user input.
29. Create a program that takes an integer as input, let´s call it turns. This integer should indicate
how many times the user wants to input a new integer. Next the program should let the user
input turns many integers. The program should then print how many negative integers the user
input, how many positive integers the user input, the sum of all the positive integers and the sum
of all the negative integers the user input.
